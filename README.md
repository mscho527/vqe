## vqe
This iPython notebook describes how VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver) can be implemented using
qiskit.

It is recommended to view `VQE.ipynb` on `nbviewer`, which does not have math formatting issues
that Github's default viewer occasionally has, by visiting
[here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mscho527/vqe/blob/master/VQE.ipynb).
